# This is a by-eye reconstruction of the duration versus energy panel
# from Hawley et al. 2014 (ApJ 797, 121) Figure 10.
#
# At chosen values of duration, I will read off the log(E_kepler)
# as well as the minimum and maximum bounds of the scatter plot
# in duration.  This is all going to be very approximate, as the
# duration axis is on a logarithmic scale.  This is meant to be
# a placeholder until such time as I can get the actual data
# underlying the figure.
